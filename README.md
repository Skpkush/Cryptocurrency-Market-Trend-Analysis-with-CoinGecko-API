### Project Title: **Cryptocurrency-Market-Trend-Analysis-with-CoinGecko-API**

### Project Description:
The **Cryptocurrency Market Trend Analysis** is a Python-based project that pulls real-time market data from the CoinGecko API to analyze cryptocurrency performance. The app fetches detailed information about the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including their current price, market cap, all-time high (ATH), all-time low (ATL), and 24-hour price change. 

The project processes and organizes the data into a structured format using Pandas and provides valuable insights such as the **Top 10 Gainers** and **Top 10 Losers** in the past 24 hours based on price change percentage. Additionally, the data is saved into an SQLite database for persistent storage and future analysis.

Users can easily interact with the data using the appâ€™s simple Streamlit interface, which presents the cryptocurrency data in an organized and user-friendly table format. This app also includes real-time data updates and can handle large volumes of market data seamlessly.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Cryptocurrency Data Fetching**: Data is fetched from the CoinGecko API, ensuring up-to-date market information.
- **Top Gainers & Losers**: Automatically identifies the top 10 cryptocurrencies with the highest gains and losses in the last 24 hours.
- **Data Persistence**: All fetched market data is saved to an SQLite database for long-term storage and retrieval.
- **Database Integration**: The project integrates SQLite to store historical data, enabling users to track market trends over time.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQLite**: For persistent data storage.
- **CoinGecko API**: For fetching cryptocurrency data.

This project offers a comprehensive solution for tracking and analyzing cryptocurrency market trends in real time while storing and visualizing historical data for deeper insights.
